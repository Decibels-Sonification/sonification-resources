# The Decibels Directory of Members

This document lists current members active in the Decibels community, sorted alphabetically by last name. We hope it can be a resource to help people connect and learn with each other. 

If you'd like to add your name to the directory, then either submit [a Github issue](https://github.com/Decibels-Sonification/sonification-resources/issues), file a [pull request](https://github.com/Decibels-Sonification/sonification-resources/pulls), or approach us in our [Discord](http://decibels.community) server and we can get you listed.

Feel free to use existing members as a template for adding information about yourself! Or if you prefer, write your own bullet points that seem to describe you best. Either way, please try to at least include a sentence about you, your location, and some links to find you elsewhere on the web.
